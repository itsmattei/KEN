# KEN pruning algorithm üï∂Ô∏è
KEN (Kernel density Estimator for Neural Network compression): a straightforward, universal and unstructured pruning algorithm based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for transformer compression.

This repository contains all the code to replicate the experiments shown in [_KEN: a Universal and Simple Non-Parametric Pruning Algorithm for Large Language Models_](https://pages.github.com/)
