This repository contains all the code to replicate the experiments shown in [_KEN: a Universal and Simple Non-Parametric Pruning Algorithm for Large Language Models_](https://pages.github.com/)

Based on the different KEN application, this repository includes the following packages:
```bash
KEN
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ easy_train                              <-- an useful package used for train in a very fast faschion your LLM
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ easy_train.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ easy_train_large_models.py         
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model_compression                       <-- for the download of the compressed model and its support dictionary
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄcompress_file.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pretrained_model_injection              <-- KEN applied the selected fine-tuned params in a pre-trained model
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inject_all_layers.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ inject_attention_layers.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trained_model_injection                 <-- KEN substitute the not selected parameters with its pre-trained values
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inject_all_layers.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ inject_attention_layers.py

KENviz                                      <-- Visualization tool
